# This is my work space to learn git. 
# If anyone has any ideas or suggestions I am all ears. 
# I am starting with a program, "base10to52.py", which converts a base ten number to any base from 2 to 52.  
# I am working towards a program that will change a number of any base to a number of any base.
# One of my problems is the choice of characters for the bases over 52.
# For the bases up to 26, I am using the numbers 0 and A - Y as my symbols for 0 - 25, where 26 is 'A0', 27 is 'AA" and so on.
# For bases higher than 26, I am using the numbers 0 for zero, A - Z as 1 - 26, and a - z as 27 - 51, where 51 is z, 52 is A0, and 78 is AZ.
# I am contemplating a system that will generate its own characters for the higher bases, but don't see the need yet to use a number higher than 100.
# I don't know all the applications this will have, if any.  It is just a level of math with which I am comfortable enough to code while learning git.
# I am beginning with a for loop in the conversion, and not using recursion yet.  I want to compair them later and decide which one to use.
